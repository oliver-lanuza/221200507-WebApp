                    Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
                    It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes
                    (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Visual Studio Code supports Portable mode installation. This mode enables all data created and maintained by VS Code to live near itself,
                    so it can be moved around across environments, for example, on a USB drive. See the VS Code Portable Mode documentation for details.

                <p>VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.</p>
                <p>Follow the platform-specific guides below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>macOS</li>
                    <li>Linux</li>

                </ul>
                <p>VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions.
                    You can review the System Requirements to check if your computer configuration is supported.

                <p>VS Code comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project.</p>
                <p>The UI is divided into five main areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Editor</strong> - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Primary Side Bar</strong> - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Status Bar</strong> - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Activity Bar</strong> - Located on the far left-hand side, this lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators,
                        like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Panel</strong> - An additional space for views below the editor region. By default, it houses output, debug information, errors and warnings, and an integrated terminal.
                        Panel can also be moved to the left or right for more vertical space.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions.
                    You can review the System Requirements to check if your computer configuration is supported.

                <p>You can configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings. Nearly every part of VS Code's editor, user interface,
                    and functional behavior has options you can modify.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VS Code provides several different scopes for settings. When you open a workspace, you will see at least the following two scopes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Settings</strong> - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.</li>
                    <li><strong>Workspace Settings</strong> - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.</li>

                The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start.
                VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.
                VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code.
                This article explains how to find, install, and manage VS Code extensions from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

            <p>
                IntelliSense is a general term for various code editing features including:
                code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists.
                IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting."
            </p>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code IntelliSense is provided for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Less out of the box.
                VS Code supports word based completions for any programming language but can also be configured to have richer IntelliSense by installing a language extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are the most popular language extensions in the Marketplace.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C/C++</li>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Extension Pack for Java</li>
                <li>Go</li>
                <li>Dart</li>
                <li>PHP Extension Pack</li>
                <li>Ruby LSP</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                VS Code IntelliSense features are powered by a language service. A language service provides intelligent code completions based on language semantics and an analysis of your source code.
                If a language service knows possible completions, the IntelliSense suggestions will pop up as you type.
                If you continue typing characters, the list of members (variables, methods, etc.) is filtered to only include members containing your typed characters.
                Pressing <code>Tab</code> or <code>Enter</code> will insert the selected member.

                    Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Visual Studio Code, snippets appear in IntelliSense (Ctrl+Space) mixed with other suggestions,
                    as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (Insert Snippet in the Command Palette).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Snippets are scoped so that only relevant snippets are suggested. Snippets can be scoped by either:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1. the language(s)</strong> to which snippets are scoped (possibly all)</li>
                    <li><strong>2. the project(s)</strong> to which snippets are scoped (probably all)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every snippet is scoped to one, several, or all ("global") languages based on whether it is defined in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1. a language snippet file</strong></li>

                    Zoom levels and High Contrast colors improve editor visibility,
                    keyboard-only navigation supports use without a mouse, and the editor is optimized for screen readers.

                    Visual Studio Code has integrated source control management (SCM) and includes Git support out-of-the-box.
                    Many other source control providers are available through extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.

                <p>
                    The Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the left will always indicate an overview of how many changes you currently have in your repository.
                    Selecting the icon will show you the details of your current repository changes: CHANGES, STAGED CHANGES and MERGE CHANGES.

                    Visual Studio Code includes a full featured integrated terminal that starts at the root of your workspace.
                    It provides integration with the editor to support features like links and error detection.
                    The integrated terminal can run commands such as mkdir and git just like a standalone terminal.
                </p>
                <p>You can open a terminal as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the menu, use the Terminal > New Terminal or View > Terminal menu commands.</li>
                    <li>From the Command Palette <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> use the View: Toggle Terminal command.</li>
                    <li>In the Explorer, you can use the Open in Integrated Terminal context menu command to open a new terminal from a folder.</li>
                    <li>To toggle the terminal panel, use the <code>Ctrl+`</code> keyboard shortcut.</li>

                    No source code needs to be on your local machine to get these benefits.
                    Each extension in the Remote Development extension pack can run commands and other extensions directly inside a container,
                    in WSL, or on a remote machine so that everything feels like it does when you run locally.
